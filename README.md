# StarAutomata
A simple automata based on greatly simplified physics concepts like gravity and momentum.  

This program simulates an automata as described above and produces images of each timestep.  Examples of these are in the images2 folder.  In the videos folder is a sample video that was stitched together using the windows video editor.  Automata2.py has more simulation options at the top of the code than Automata.py.
